YAML Test
=========

A Complete Sharable Test Suite for YAML

= Description

This is a comprehensive test suite for YAML. Each test case is a directory
under the `test/` directory. The `tag/` directory contains subdirectories that
are "tags" containing symlinks to test cases for that tag.

= File Names

Within a test case there are files that can be used for all sorts of testing:

* Parsing
* Loading
* Emitting
* Dumping
* Type resolution

The following file names are used:

- `test.yaml`

  This is YAML input file, that is meant to be parsed and/or loaded depending
  on the test. It can also serve as the canonical output file if no
  `test.out.yaml` exists.

- `test.json`

  This is a JSON file that contains the equivalent data that the YAML should
  load into.

- `test.out.yaml`

  This is the YAML that a Dumper or Emitter is expected to produce.

- `test.2.yaml`

  An alternate YAML input file that loads as the same JSON structure.

- `test.event`

  An event syntax, one event per line, that YAML would parse to or emit from.
