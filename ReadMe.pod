=head1 Name

YAML Test - A Complete Sharable Test Suite for YAML

=head1 Description

This is a comprehensive test suite for YAML. Each test case is a directory
under the C<test/> directory. The C<tag/> directory contains subdirectories
that are "tags" containing symlinks to test cases for that tag.

=head1 File Names

Within a test case there are files that can be used for all sorts of testing:

=over

=item * Parsing

=item * Loading

=item * Emitting

=item * Dumping

=item * Type resolution

=back

The following file names are used:

=over

=item C<test.yaml>

This is YAML input file, that is meant to be parsed and/or loaded depending on
the test. It can also serve as the canonical output file if no
C<test.out.yaml> exists.

=item C<test.json>

This is a JSON file that contains the equivalent data that the YAML should
load into.

=item C<test.out.yaml>

This is the YAML that a Dumper or Emitter is expected to produce.

=item C<test.2.yaml>

An alternate YAML input file that loads as the same JSON structure.

=item C<test.event>

An event syntax, one event per line, that YAML would parse to or emit from.

=back
