This is an experimental concept, where | and > is replaced by single " and '.


----- Current Concept

To deal with indent detection, when there is lots of spaces initially. Use the backslash plus space char. "\".

To deal with trailing newlines, use optional closing quotes"

----- Discarded concept ----

Parser would operate by detecting newline immediately after " or ', and then attempt to locate the first ==== marker, which determines the indent lines, and also the end ==== markers if present. (should it be ---- instead?)

literal_startmark: "
====
    A literal block keeps all
    new lines.

folded_startmark: '
====
    A folded block will get rid
    of its newlines.

literal_newlines: "
====
    A literal block keeps all
    new lines.

====

folded_newlines: '
====
    A folded block will get rid
    of its newlines.

====

------ OLD STYLE ----


This test the ability of YAML to deal with string data

Also test the ability to quote/unquote a string. Also checks if literal or folded blok j

	string_unquoted: This is a single lined string
	string_quoted: "This is a single lined string"
	literal: |
		A literal block keeps all
		new lines.
	folded: >
		A folded block will get rid
		of its newlines.
