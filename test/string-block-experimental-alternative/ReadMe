This is an experimental concept, where | and > is replaced by single " and '.

Parser would operate by detecting newline immediately after " or ', and then attempt to locate the first ---- marker, which determines the indent lines, and also the end ---- markers if present. (should it be ===? instead?)

------ OLD STYLE ----


This test the ability of YAML to deal with string data

Also test the ability to quote/unquote a string. Also checks if literal or folded blok j

	string_unquoted: This is a single lined string
	string_quoted: "This is a single lined string"
	literal: |
		A literal block keeps all
		new lines.
	folded: >
		A folded block will get rid
		of its newlines.
