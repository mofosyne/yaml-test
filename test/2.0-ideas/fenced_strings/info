So the idea behind this, is that it is much easier to remember how to use. 

The logic is that single " in string_folded in is essentially a split up version of `string_folded: " ... "`

While for multi line... you would emphasis on it's multi line.

This is better than saying `|` and `>`, which is rather abstract. 


string_multiline:
   """
   This is a multiline
   in yaml source
   it is made up of 
   lots of lines
   """
   
string_folded:
   "
   This is a multiline
   in yaml source
   it is made up of 
   lots of lines
   "
