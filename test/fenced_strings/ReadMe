So the idea behind this, is that it is much easier to remember how to use. 

The logic is that single " in string_folded in is essentially a split up version of `string_folded: " ... "`

While for multi line... you would emphasis on it's multi line.

This is better than saying `|` and `>`, which is rather abstract. 


string_multiline:
   """
   This is a multiline
   in yaml source
   it is made up of 
   lots of lines
   """
   
string_folded:
   '''
   This is a multiline
   in yaml source
   it is made up of 
   lots of lines
   '''

edit: replaced the single quote char ", with ', since that is more obvious.

# Problems to solve:
* Indentation level
* Character semantics
* Trailing newline or not
* Which ''' sets the indent
* What variants throw errors
* Is trailing ''' needed?
* Where does leading ''' need to go?
* Can text be on same line as ''' (Like in Python)

# I think this is an error in current YAML
# YAML looks at indent of first line
code: |
      # comment
    def foo():
      pass
 
# This means 2 space indent:
code: |2
      # comment
    def foo():
      pass
